# Util Scripts
The following scripts are all useful for knowing what variables there are to use in the analysis. Because there are so many scripts here, we have this README file to keep a listing of all the files and what they do.

## Descpriptions

- **printBranches.py**

  This prints all the different branches/variables we have available for NanoAODv9.

- **print_variable_declaration.py**

  It checks for variables that match the one we give as input and it prints out the NanoAODv9 declaration for them in the TSelector.

- **retrieveVariables.py**

  This checks a version of files for each year of Run 2 with MC and data. It's a good idea to run this before using the **print_variable_declaration.py** macro.
